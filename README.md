# KeepAwake
Keeping windows from sleeping when a process has a transfer speed that exeed a configurable limit (in Kb/s).
To change the process name and the process speed limit just edit the .config file.
The process must have the process name without file extension.
I use it to prevent the sleeping of my pc when I'm transferring files via ftp from my download box.
